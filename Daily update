Last week, I worked on a few tasks. The first was creating a VPC using Terraform in the POS Shared AQA account. I faced some issues initially, but they are now resolved.
I also created a release branch, worked on an integrator token-related ticket, and fixed an issue where a transition was missing by adding a new one.

Today, I enabled malware scanning in GuardDuty for all S3 buckets under the Genius Restaurant accounts.
Honestly, I’m not sure whether this task should be performed through the master account or individually for each account, so I’m gathering that information first before proceeding further.
